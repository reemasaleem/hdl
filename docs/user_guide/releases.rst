Releases
===============================================================================

The HDL is released as git branches bi-annually. The release branches
are created first and then tested before being made official. That is,
the existence of a branch does not mean it is a fully tested release.
Also, the release branch is tested ONLY on certain versions of the tools
and may NOT work with other versions of the tools. The projects that are
tested and supported in a release branch are listed here along with the
ADI library cores that are used. The branch may contain other projects
that are in development, one must assume these are NOT tested and
therefore NOT supported by this release.

Porting a release branch to another Tool version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to port a release branch to another tool version, though
not recommended. The ADI libraries should work across different versions
of the tools, but the projects may not. The issues are most likely with
the Intel and Xilinx cores. If you must still do this, note the
following:

First, disable the version check of the scripts.

The ADI build scripts are making sure that the releases are being run on
the validated tool version. It will promptly notify the user if he or
she trying to use an unsupported version of tools. You need to disable
this check by setting the environment variable ADI_IGNORE_VERSION_CHECK.

Second, make Intel and Xilinx IP cores version changes.

The Intel projects should automatically be changed by Quartus. The
Xilinx projects are a bit tricky. The GUI automatically updates the
cores, but the TCL flow does NOT. So it may be easier to create the
project file with the supported version first, then opening it with the
new version. After which, update the TCL scripts accordingly.

The versions are specified in the following format.

.. code-block:: tcl
   :linenos: 

   add_instance sys_cpu altera_nios2_gen2 16.0 
   set sys_mb [create_bd_cell -type ip -vlnv xilinx.com:ip:microblaze:9.5 sys_mb] 

You should now be able to build the design and test things out. In most
cases, it should work without much effort. If it doesn't do an
incremental update and debug accordingly.
